# Blockchain based solution for self driving cars
 
Self-Driving cars is new revolution in automotive industry where many giant companies and research organizations are working to build autonomous system for self-driving cars. Till date, self-driving cars are working with the help on centralized server where server sends some commands for self-driving cars to execute and AI software developed inside, further executes commands.  
 
In past few years, researchers had identified some threats in self-driving cars that were because of frequent disconnections with server, AI based software is not accurate, payment system are fraudulent, etc. In order to solve some of the issues we propose a blockchain based system which is decentralized and have in built payment system which will indeed help increase securities within the system.  
 
In the proposed system, we developed a blockchain based system where each user can register as a passenger and each car can register as driver and a successful car ride can take place without data tampering or any loss of connection. The system is capable enough to start the ride, end the ride, calculate ride fare and accept payments from the passengers and passengers have full control over the system.
